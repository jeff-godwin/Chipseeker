# Chipseeker

Chipseeker is a R package used for analysing and annotating the regions near the peaks called (Macs2 output) from ChIP sequencing data.

This is my first try with ChIP seq data. Any suggestions/improvements/coorections are welcome.

This can be used for peaks from ATAC sequencing data as well.
